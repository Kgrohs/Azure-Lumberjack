November 12th Objectives from Proposal:

Add additional Log Sources (Not Database)
Add Endpoints: Email logs, SQL logs 
Determine if they belong in the same table, or how to organize all of this data on the page.
Display all information on the page
make it look nice. 
Add ability to select log entry/entries and maybe view their information in more detail.

What I actually got done:

What I actually did is switch to Azure (which is making the server management basically none existent), which allowed me
to actually focus on coding, I've wasted so much development time on server configuration. I used the same user template, but
the app doesn't currently do anything with the users. My stretch goal outlines what users would be useful for.

I'm currently pulling Log data from two different sources and sorting the content based on date. I'm adding context to the
Log entries as to which connection they are coming from. Having more than one connection has proven quite tricky.. my current
implementation seems inefficient but I don't believe that the app is too slow.. yet. My next goal (which might be done by the 
time you grade this) is adding more filtering to the log entries, some drop downs, some text box search. Once I've conquered that
I'll move on to adding an additional data source other than a database with a very specific table schema.
